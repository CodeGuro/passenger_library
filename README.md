# Phusion Passenger documentation project

Welcome to the Passenger documentation project. The goal of this project is to write excellent documentation for the [Phusion Passenger application server](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/).

You can view the live version of this documentation at [https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/).

Documentation is written in markdown and HTML. The final output is generated through the [Middleman static site generator](https://middlemanapp.com/).

## Contributing

You can contribute documentation by adding or editing files in the `source` directory. Feel free to send us a pull request.
