<h1>Deployment: installations</h1>

<p>Before deploying your app you have to make sure that Ruby and Passenger are installed.</p>

<h2>Did you already install Ruby?</h2>
<%= render_partial('/shared/yes_no_input', locals: {target:'/tutorials/deploy_to_production/shared/ruby', language_type: :ruby}) %>

<h2>Installing Passenger + <%= render_partial('/shared/integration') %> on a <%= render_partial('/tutorials/deploy_to_production/shared/platform') %> production server</h2>

<p>
  Now it is time to install Passenger. Please start by selecting the operating system that your server is running on, or an installation method that you prefer.
</p>

<% locals = {integration_mode_type: :nginx, edition_type: :oss, web_server_name: 'Nginx'} %>
<%= render_partial("/tutorials/deploy_to_production/shared/install", locals: locals) %>
