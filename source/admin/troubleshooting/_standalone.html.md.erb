### Upon uploading a file, Passenger reports "client_body_temp/00000000xx failed (2: No such file or directory)"

#### Symptoms

When performing an HTTP POST call, the request sometimes fails, with Passenger reporting an error along the lines of:

~~~
/tmp/passenger-standalone.8583/client_body_temp/0000000022" failed (2: No such
file or directory), client: 127.0.0.1, server: www.foo.com
~~~

#### Cause

Passenger buffers HTTP POST bodies (file uploads) to a temporary directory, by default `/tmp/passenger-standalone.xxx`. This error means that Passenger that that directory has been removed, probably by some other program.

#### Solution

Tell Passenger to use a different directory to store its temporary files by setting the `TMPDIR` environment variable. For example:

~~~bash
mkdir $HOME/tmp
cd /path-to-your-app
export TMPDIR=$HOME/tmp
passenger start
~~~
