### The application reports during startup that it cannot find a gem

#### Symptoms

Despite the fact that you have already run `bundle install`, you see an error page that contains the following messages:

~~~
It looks like Bundler could not find a gem. Maybe you didn't install all the gems that this application needs. To install your gems, please run:

  bundle install

...

Could not find XXX in any of the sources (Bundler::GemNotFound)
~~~

#### Causes and solutions

The most common cause of this problem, is that your system has multiple Ruby interpreter (or multiple RVM gemsets), and your application is not being run under the correct Ruby interpreter. The `bundle install` command installs gems into a directory that is specific to one Ruby interpreter, so when your app is being run under a different Ruby interpreter, Bundler cannot find its gems.

To solve this problem, you must explicitly tell Passenger what Ruby interpreter to use.
<% if integration_mode_type == :nginx -%>
  You can do this with the [passenger_ruby](<%= url_for "/config/nginx/reference/index.html" %>#passenger_ruby) configuration option.
<% elsif integration_mode_type == :apache -%>
  You can do this with the [PassengerRuby](<%= url_for "/config/apache/reference/index.html" %>#passengerruby) configuration option.
<% else -%>
  You can do this with the [`--ruby` / "ruby"](<%= url_for "/config/standalone/reference/index.html" %>#--ruby-ruby).
<% end -%>

The second most common cause of this problem, is that your application is being run under the wrong user. The `bundle install` command often installs gems into a user-specific directory. So if Passenger for some reason runs your app as a different user than the one that invoked `bundle install`, Bundler may not be able to find its gems.
<% if integration_mode_type == :nginx || integration_mode_type == :apache -%>
Read [Sandboxing apps with Unix user accounts](<%= url_for "/deploy/#{integration_mode_type}/user_sandboxing.html" %>) to learn why Passenger may run your application as a different user.
<% end -%>

To solve this problem, you must explicit tell Passenger what user to run as
<% if integration_mode_type == :nginx -%>
  by using the [passenger_user](<%= url_for "/config/nginx/reference/index.html" %>#passenger_user) configuration option.
<% elsif integration_mode_type == :apache -%>
  by using the [PassengerUser](<%= url_for "/config/apache/reference/index.html" %>#passengeruser) configuration option.
<% else -%>
  by using the [`--user` / "user"](<%= url_for "/config/standalone/reference/index.html" %>#--user-user) option.
<% end %>

If this didn't solve your problem, try following the tips in the error message. Also be sure to double check the settings printed on the error page. Be sure to double check all environment variables, user IDs, etc and check whether they are what you expect.
