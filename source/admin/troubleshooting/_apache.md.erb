### macOS: The installer cannot locate MAMP's Apache

#### Symptoms

The installer finds Apache 2 development headers at `/Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/apxs`. However, Apache cannot be found. The installer also outputs the following error:

~~~
cannot open /Applications/MAMP/Library/build/config_vars.mk:
No such file or directory at /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/apxs line 218.
~~~

#### Cause

Your MAMP installation seems to be broken. In particular, 'config_vars.mk' is missing.

#### Solution

Please read [this forum topic](http://forum.mamp.info/viewtopic.php?t=1866) to learn how to fix this problem. See also [this bug report](https://github.com/phusion/passenger/issues/113).

### Apache reports a "403 Forbidden" error

Please refer to [Static assets such as images and stylesheets aren't being displayed](#static-assets-such-as-images-and-stylesheets-arent-being-displayed).

### Static assets such as images and stylesheets aren't being displayed

Static assets are accelerated, i.e. they are served directly by Apache and do not go through the application. There are two reasons why Apache doesn't serve static assets correctly:

 1. Your Apache configuration is too strict, and does not allow HTTP clients to access static assets. This can be achieved with an `Allow from all` directive in the correct place. For example:

    ~~~
    <Directory "/webapps/mycook/public">
       Options FollowSymLinks
       AllowOverride None
       Order allow,deny
       Allow from all
       Options -MultiViews
       # Uncomment this if you're on Apache >= 2.4:
       #Require all granted
    </Directory>
    ~~~

    See also [this discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/phusion-passenger/browse_thread/thread/9699a639a87f85f4/b9d71a03bf2670a5).

 2. The Apache process doesn't have permission to access your application's directory. Please make sure that the application's directory, as well as all of its parent directories, have the correct permissions and/or ownerships.

### Apache cannot access my app's files because of SELinux errors

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS, Apache is locked down by a security mechanism called SELinux. This security mechanism works on top of normal Unix permissions. In order for Apache to be able to access your app's files, you must set the proper SELinux labels on your files.

First, ensure that your app does not live in a home directory. It is not possible to allow Apache to read files from your home directory.

Second, give your app's files the `httpd_sys_content_t` labels by running the following command:

~~~bash
sudo chcon -R -h -t httpd_sys_content_t /path-to-your-app
~~~

### The application thinks its not on SSL even though it is

Rails and many other frameworks infers whether it's running on SSL through the CGI environment variable `HTTPS`. Apache always sets this variable when on SSL, except when SSL is incorrectly configured.

Most Apache installations already configure SSL by default on port 443 (conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf). Some people think they can save some typing in subsequent SSL vhost blocks, and omit important options like 'SSLEngine on', like this:

~~~
# httpd-ssl.conf contains something like:
# <VirtualHost _default_:443>
#     SSLEngine on
#     ...
# </VirtualHost>
Include conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf

<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName www.example.com
    DocumentRoot /webapps/example/public
</Virtualhost>
~~~

**This is wrong!** In each SSL vhost block you must re-specify all the SSL options. Otherwise Apache won't properly detect the vhost as an SSL vhost block. Here's the corrected example:

~~~
Include conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf

<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName www.example.com
    DocumentRoot /webapps/example/public
    SSLEngine on
    ...more SSL options here...
</Virtualhost>
~~~

### Conflicting Apache modules

Some Apache modules are not compatible with Passenger. They may be loaded simultaneously with Passenger, but they may not be enabled simultaneously in the same virtual hosts.

#### mod_userdir

`mod_userdir` is not compatible with Passenger at the moment.

#### MultiViews (mod_negotiation)

MultiViews is not compatible with Passenger. You must disable MultiViews for all Passenger hosts.

#### VirtualDocumentRoot

VirtualDocumentRoot is not compatible with Passenger at the moment.
