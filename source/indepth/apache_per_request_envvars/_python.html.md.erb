### The WSGI environment dict

Per-request environment variables can be accessed through [the WSGI environment dict](http://wsgi.tutorial.codepoint.net/environment-dictionary). This dict contains all information about the request, including per-request environment variables.

Pretty much all Python web frameworks are built in top of WSGI. If you are using a web framework, then please refer to your framework's documentation to find out how to access the WSGI environment dict.

Suppose that your site is using SSL, and that you that `SSLOptions StdEnvVars` enabled. You can access the `SSL_SESSION_ID` environment variable as follows:

~~~ruby
env = framework_specific_code_to_obtain_the_wsgi_dict()
env['SSL_SESSION_ID']   # => ...session ID value...
~~~

### The `os.environ` object

When Passenger handles a request and decides to spawn a new application process, Passenger will store the values of any per-request environment variables into OS-level environment variables. This is only done once per application process, and only when the application process is spawned.

This is primarily useful for ensuring that the `SetEnv` directive works as expected. For example, suppose that you have this in your Apache configuration file:

~~~apache
SetEnv APP_NAME mydemoapp
~~~

You can then access `APP_NAME` using `os.environ`, which is a mechanism in Python for accessing OS-level environment variables:

~~~python
os.environ['APP_NAME']   # => "mydemoapp"
~~~

There are three important caveats to be aware of:

 1. `os.environ` should not be confused with the WSGI environment object, which is often called `env`. The WSGI environment object is something totally different, and is for accessing per-request information. `os.environ` is for accessing OS-level environment variables.
 2. `os.environ` does not change, so it must not be used for accessing per-request environment variables whose values may change on a per-request basis. For example, do not call `os.environ['SSL_SESSION_ID']` because `SSL_SESSION_ID` changes on a per-client basis.
 3. If Passenger spawns an application process, but not as part of handling a request, then that application process will not have per-request environment variables stored inside OS-level environment variables.
