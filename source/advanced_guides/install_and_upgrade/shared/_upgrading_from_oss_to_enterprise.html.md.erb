Passenger comes in two variants: an open source version, as well as an [Enterprise version](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/enterprise) which introduces a myriad of useful features that can improve stability and performance and efficiency.

Customers who have bought Passenger Enterprise can upgrade their open source installation to Enterprise as follows:

 1. [Uninstall the open source Passenger](uninstall/oss/).
 2. Install Passenger Enterprise by following one of the [deployment tutorials](../../walkthroughs/deploy/) or [installation guides](.). When following a deployment tutorial, be sure to select "I use am using the Enterprise edition" during the "Open source vs Enterprise" step.

The uninstallation is necessary because the Enterprise Ruby gem has a different gem name ('passenger-enterprise-server' instead of 'passenger'), but the same administration command names (e.g. `passenger-status`). Uninstalling the open source version avoids any conflicts.
