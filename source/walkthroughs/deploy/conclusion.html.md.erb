Congratulations, you have successfully deployed your web application using Passenger!

To fully master Passenger, please take a look at [the various guides](<%= url_for "/index.html" %>#guides) in the Passenger Library.

You may be particularly interested in the [Deployment automation guide](<%= url_for "/deploy/#{integration_mode_type}/automating_app_updates/#{language_type}/index.html" %>), which teaches you how to automatically deploy future application updates without so much manual work.
