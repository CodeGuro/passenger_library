<h1>Deploying a <%= language_name %> app with Passenger to production</h1>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.phusionpassenger.com/">Passenger</a> is an open source <strong>web application server</strong> for <%= language_name %>. It handles HTTP requests, manages processes and resources, and enables administration, monitoring and problem diagnosis. Passenger is very easy to use, makes deploying in production much easier and is scalable.
</p>

<h4>What is this tutorial?</h4>
<p>
  This is an <em>end-to-end tutorial</em> that teaches you how to install <%= language_name %> and Passenger on a production server. This tutorial will ask you some questions, so the exact tutorial steps depend on the choices you make. In general, it covers these topics:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Launching a server</li>
  <li>Installing the <%= language_name %> runtime</li>
  <li>Installing Passenger</li>
  <li>Setting up the production server in preparation for the application, such as creating a Unix user account and setting up permissions</li>
  <li>Deploying the application itself</li>
  <li>Updating the application to newer versions</li>
  <li>Optional integration with a web server, such as Nginx or Apache</li>
</ol>
