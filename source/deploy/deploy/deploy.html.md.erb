<h1>Deploying <%= language_name_with_determiner %> application<br>
<small>on Passenger <%= integration_mode_name_as_passenger_suffix %></small></h1>

This guide teaches you how you can deploy your app to a server. This guide assumes that you have already done the following, and that you know how to do them:

<ul>
<% if integration_mode_type == :nginx || integration_mode_type == :apache %>
  <li>Passenger and <%= integration_mode_name %> are already installed on the server.</li>
<% elsif integration_mode_type == :standalone %>
  <% if language_type != :ruby %>
    <li>Passenger is already installed on the server.</li>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
  <li>You have already transferred the application's code to the server.</li>
  <li>You have already installed <%= language_runtime_name %>.</li>
  <li>You have already installed all necessary dependencies that your application needs.</li>
</ul>

If you miss one of these prerequisites or don't know how to perform it, then we recommend you to follow the [Deployment tutorial](<%= url_for "/walkthroughs/deploy/#{language_type}/index.html" %>). The deployment tutorial is end-to-end guide and teaches you how to install every component.
